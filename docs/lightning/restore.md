# Restore Lightning Wallet

If you have created a Lighting Wallet in the past and need to recover it, you can do so via the myNode interface.

**You will need your seed phrase and Static Channel Backup file!**

First, click on Manage under the Lightning app on the myNode home page.

Then, click on "Restore Wallet from Seed" on the Lightning page. 

**Note:** You will only see the Restore button if no wallet exists. If a wallet had been created, you will first need to delete the Lightning wallet via the settings page.

On the next page, enter your seed phrase and upload your Static Channel Backup (SCB) file. Click Create.

This will restore you on-chain balance, close all channels that had been opened, and restore those funds in you on chain wallet. Seeing the channel funds appear may take a while.

Your Lightning wallet is now setup and ready to use!
